## BOOST-EDS

-   Proof-of-concept cloud workflow
-   Demonstrate EDS services within BAS
-   JASMIN Object Store, Datalabs
-   Records barriers and feed into WP4

## Technical Overview

## Use-case 1: Amundsen Sea Low Index (ASLI)

-   Highly dynamic, mobile climatological low pressure system
-   Crucial in understanding regional change over West Antarctica
-   Good ASL representation improve climate models

## Use-case 1: User requirements

1.  Run monthly, when new ERA5 data is released
2.  Human in-the-loop to approve data transfer
3.  Automatic ingestion into the PDC, appending dataset
4.  ERA5 re-calculation detection, triggering new DOI
5.  Datalabs notebooks/application to interact with data

## Use-case 1: Technical Overview

## Use-case 1: Summary
- Useful demonstration of EDS services
- Exposes limitations in current EDS offering
- Not a genomics dataset
- Quick implementation, project needs
- Focus is on feeding into WP4

## Multi-Omics for Polar Science

-   Multi-omics for studying and understanding polar life, Clark et al. (2023)
-   Adaptation to extremely cold environments
-   Autonomous remote collection of environmental DNA (eDNA) using AUVs
-   Sampling Bias to accessible sites

## 2nd Generation Environmental Sampling Processors (2G-ESP)

-   Demonstrated for eDNA sampling in commercial fish (Hansen et al. 2020)
-   Integrated Analysis
-   Challenge is instrument size.
-   Deployed in fixed/moored location.

## 3rd Generation ESP (3G-ESP)

-   Development of 3G-ESP, for deployment in AUV
-   Demonstrated in Monterey Bay (Yamahara et al. 2019)
-   Allow sampling in remote areas of Southern Ocean and Antarctic Peninsula
-   At the expense of integrated analysis = lag time between sampling and analysis

## BAS and NERC Interaction

-   New Â£0.9m NERC-funded Marine Robotics Facility
-   Remote communications expertise
-   Deep field deployment
-   PDC + EDS expertise

### Proposal
- And end-to-end solution to ingesting multi-omics data into Digital Twins
- Bridge several gaps, integrated analysis on AUVs, IoT edge, sampling bias, genomics in DT, and more!

## Technical Draft

## Future Project Summary

-   Integrated Analysis for 3G-ESP
-   Close accessible site sampling bias
-   Reproducible Pipeline integrating with Data Commons & EDS cloud infrastructure
-   Incorporate polar biodiversity in federated Digital Twin
