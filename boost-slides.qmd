## Technical Overview

Overview of a "general" project


## Use-case 1: Amundsen Sea Low Index (ASLI)
- Highly dynamic, mobile climatological low pressure system
- Crucial in understanding regional change over West Antarctica
- Good ASL representation improve climate models

## Use-case 1: User requirements
1. Run monthly, when new ERA5 data is released
2. Human in-the-loop to approve data transfer
3. Automatic ingestion into the PDC, appending dataset
4. ERA5 re-calculation detection, triggering new DOI

## Use-case 1: Technical Overview

## Use-case 1: Summary
- Useful demonstration of EDS services
- Exposes limitations in current EDS offering
- Not a genomics dataset

## Multi-Omics for Polar Science
- Multi-omics for studying and understanding polar life, Clark et al. (2023)
- Adaptation to extremely cold environments
- Autonomous remote collection of environmental DNA (eDNA)
- Sampling Bias to accessible sites

## 2nd Generation Environmental Sampling Processors (2G-ESP)
- Demonstrated for eDNA sampling in commercial fish (Hansen et al. 2020)
- Challenge is instrument size.
- Deployed in fixed/moored location.

## 3rd Generation ESP (3G-ESP)
- Development of 3G-ESP, for deployment in autonomous underwater vehichles (AUV)
- Demonstrated in Monterey Bay (Yamahara et al. 2019)
- Allow sampling in remote areas of Southern Ocean and Antarctic Peninsula

## BAS and NERC Interaction
- New £0.9m NERC-funded Marine Robotics Facility
- Remote communications expertise
- Reproducible Pipeline integrating with Data Commons & EDS cloud infrastructure
- Incorporate polar biodiversity in federated Digital Twin
