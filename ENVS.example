##
# Most of the variables below will not need changing
# The asli package looks for /data/ERA5/monthly, so does not need changing
# 
# Note ASLI_VENV is set as asli_env, as per the setup instructions
# Change this if you gave it a different name

## Directories
# Should not need editing, but you can do so if you wish
# Location that pipeline is stored, referenced by most scripts
export PIPELINE_DIRECTORY=$( cd -- "$( dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" &> /dev/null && pwd )

# Set input and output directories, asli functions do not handle this 
export DATA_DIR=${DATA_DIR:-${PIPELINE_DIRECTORY}/data/ERA5/monthly}
export OUTPUT_DIR=${OUTPUT_DIR:-${PIPELINE_DIRECTORY}/output}

# Specify environment so it does not need to be called prior to running
export ASLI_VENV=${ASLI_VENV:-${PIPELINE_DIRECTORY}/asli_env/bin/activate}

# Get the asli version
export ASLI_VERSION=$(pip freeze | grep asli)

## Performance
# Number of parallel jobs to run asli_cal withs
export NUM_CORES=20

## Validation Checks
# Whether this is the first run against a file destination
# Setting this to true will prevent the pipeline from running verification
# against a file that does not yet exist
export FIRST_RUN=true

## File Movement
# Specify the destination of the files and export method
# This will also determine file format (ie .nc or .zarr, .csv or .parquet)
# Choose either OBJECT_STORAGE, FILE_SYSTEM, or BOTH
export FILE_DESTINATION=FILE_SYSTEM

# These are 
export VALID_DESTINATIONS=(OBJECT_STORAGE, FILE_SYSTEM, BOTH)

# Setting S3 bucket, if using
# The endpoint is set in your .s3cfg file
export S3_BUCKET=""

# Setting rsync location, if using
export RSYNC_LOCATION="/users/thozwa/test_destination"

# Set dates and current year for iteration purposes
export CURRENT_DATE="`date --utc +"%Y_%m_%d"`"
export CURRENT_YEAR="`date --utc +"%Y"`"

## Data querying parameters
# ERA5 Downloading parameters
export START_YEAR=1959
export END_YEAR=${CURRENT_YEAR}
export DATA_ARGS_ERA5="-s ${START_YEAR} -n ${CURRENT_YEAR}"

# FILE_IDENTIFIER will what the output filename is called
# ie asli_calculation_$FILE_IDENTIFIER.csv
# Depending on how you are organising your files, you might want this 
# To be the CURRENT_YEAR, CURRENT_DATE or another unique ID
export FILE_IDENTIFIER="${START_YEAR}_to_${CURRENT_YEAR}"

## Quality control parameters
# These values are used to sense-check asli calculation outputs
# Standard deviations from the mean, to check no values lie outwith SD_FROM_MEAN
export SD_FROM_MEAN=4
# Checking for outliers outwith Mahalanobis distance of MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATIONS
export MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATIONS=10
# Values of bounds we expect ActCenPres to be in
export ACTCENPRES_BOUNDS_MIN=900
export ACTCENPRES_BOUNDS_MAX=1100
