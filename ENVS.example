# Most of the variables below will not need changing
# The asli package looks for /data/ERA5/monthly, so does not need changing
# 
# Note ASLI_VENV is set as asli_env, as per the setup instructions
# Change this if you gave it a different name

## Directories
# Should not need editing, but you can do so if you wish
# Location that pipeline is stored, referenced by most scripts
export PIPELINE_DIRECTORY=$( cd -- "$( dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" &> /dev/null && pwd )

# Set input and output directories, asli functions do not handle this 
export DATA_DIR=${DATA_DIR:-${PIPELINE_DIRECTORY}/data/ERA5/monthly}
export OUTPUT_DIR=${OUTPUT_DIR:-${PIPELINE_DIRECTORY}/output}

# Specify environment so it does not need to be called prior to running
export ASLI_VENV=${ASLI_VENV:-${PIPELINE_DIRECTORY}/asli_env/bin/activate}

## File Movement
# Specify the destination of the files and export method
# This will also determine file format (ie .nc or .zarr, .csv or .parquet)
# Choose either OBJECT_STORAGE, FILE_SYSTEM, or BOTH
export FILE_DESTINATION=OBJECT_STORAGE

# These are 
export VALID_DESTINATIONS=(OBJECT_STORAGE, FILE_SYSTEM, BOTH)

# Setting S3 bucket, if using
# The endpoint is set in your .s3cfg file
export S3_BUCKET="s3://asli"

# Setting rsync location, if using
export RSYNC_LOCATION=""

# Set dates and current year for iteration purposes
export CURRENT_DATE="`date --utc +"%Y_%m_%d"`"
export CURRENT_YEAR="`date --utc +"%Y"`"

## Data querying parameters
# ERA5 Downloading parameters
export START_YEAR=${CURRENT_YEAR}
export END_YEAR=${CURRENT_YEAR}
export DATA_ARGS_ERA5="-s ${START_YEAR} -n ${END_YEAR}"

# FILE_IDENTIFYER will what the output filename is called
# ie asli_calculation_$FILE_IDENTIFYER.csv
# Depending on how you are organising your files, you might want this 
# To be the CURRENT_YEAR, CURRENT_DATE or another unique ID
export FILE_IDENTIFYER=${CURRENT_YEAR}
